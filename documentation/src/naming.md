# Naming Conventions

Names should be descriptive; avoid abbreviations.
Give a descriptive name, but be specific. Do not worry about saving horizontal space, as it is far more important to make your code immediately understandable by a new reader. We do not contract words or make up words.

## We use English words for abstractions

* The programming language is in English, most concepts are in English, therefore English is a lot easier to make consistent. (WriteExportAbacusEinFile, etc.)
* Most of the concepts except a few in the building industry are already in English.
* We want to avoid being confused about GetProject vs GetProjekt. For a single concept, only one word in one language should be chosen.
* Avoid variables like workWork (sic)
* It is a lot easier to create plurals in English (-s, -ies) where in German it might be difficult: Kapitel, Mitarbeiter, Unternehmer, Fenster, Artikel (see also next point)
* Proper Nouns  should not be translated even if possible.
* We try to use the same word for the same abstraction. It is either a project or a tenant. (DDD)

## Be specific

Only use generic words like, data, list, string, number, manager, gateway and handler if necessary in a generic context. Otherwise, try to find specific domain words. Build a domain specific ubiquitous language.
In domain context, always use the domain vocabulary and try keeping the overhead to a minimum, be precise.

## Abbrevations
We do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside our project, and we do not abbreviate by skipping letters within a word. Abbreviations that would be familiar to someone outside your project with relevant domain knowledge are OK. As a rule of thumb, an abbreviation is probably OK if it is listed in Wikipedia like IP or HTML.
All abbreviations are written in PascalCase.

```csharp
class JsonToHtmlConverter
{
}
class IpAddress
{
}
class UserId
{
}
class TfsConnector
{
}
```
*Abbrevation Examples*

## Use plural and singular to your advantage

If you have a collection of things, use the plural form of the variable you would use for a single element. Prefer being specific, as the name of the collection should reflect the meaning behind its elements. This gives you a natural understanding on what object you are dealing with.

```csharp
var onlineUsers = GetOnlineUsers();
for (var user in onlineUsers) {
    user.GoOffline();
}
```
*Correct usage of plural*

## Try to use the same word for the same concept

Do not switch between different name for a concept, make a choice and stick to it.

## Naming the different C# identifiers

Table following table gives you the rules for each identifier.

## UI Elements
When dealing with UI Elements like buttons, combo boxes, grids, text boxes, etc. we append the full name of the type without any prefix to the variable name. 

```csharp
class UserRightDialog
{
    Grid _userGrid;
    Edit _userNameEdit;
    Button _okButton;
};
```
*Naming of UI Elements*

## Naming of delegate variables

All delegate variables should be in camelCase without a prefix or postfix. All other Methods are PascalCase which means if you see a createThing(), you will know that it is indeed a delegate call.

## Naming of Tests

The naming of tests must describe what the intended effect of the methods that are being tested, e.g. `ReturnsNullOnEmptySettings` or `ThrowsOnInvalidResponse`.
